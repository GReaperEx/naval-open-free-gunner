# Naval Open - Free Gunner

Damn, I missed this game! Its music, its gameplay, its everything. Unfortunately though, my PS2 is broken and by laptop is too slow for emulators... So I figured I'd try to reverse engineer it. 8-D

This is a tool to help me use and navigate the games PS2 files. You must have a copy of the game, either in image or hard form, in order to use this.

- Play the music files
- Play the sound effect files
- Play the video files
- Browse through the VCD, with some basic commands
